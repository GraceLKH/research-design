#### 5.1.1 Strengths
1.	Ease of Use: Scopus is designed to be intuitive for both new and experienced users. The platform offers simple navigation with clearly labelled sections, making it easy to find and access desired features. Comprehensive help guides and tutorials are available to assist users in maximizing their use of the tool.

2.	Interface: The interface is clean and modern, with a well-organized layout that facilitates quick access to key functionalities. For example, the searching page includes 4 tabs: documents (filter by keywords), authors (filter by researchers’ name), researcher discovery (filter by specific research area) and organizations. Pages are responsive and load quickly, enhancing the overall user experience.

3.	Search Functionalities: Scopus provides add search field (additional search field), add date range (filter to specific publication date, but manually input is not allowed, only allow scroll and select) and advanced search options (enter query string and add author name / affiliation). Users can apply comprehensive filters and sorting options to refine search results, making it easier to locate relevant articles.

#### 5.1.2	Weaknesses
Some of the advanced features might require familiarization for users who are not well-versed with academic databases.

### 5.2	Web of Science (WoS)

#### 5.2.1 Strengths
1.   Ease of Use: While WoS has a steeper learning curve, it is highly effective for users familiar with academic databases. The platform requires some initial effort to master but offers detailed help resources and tutorials to support users.

2.   Interface: The interface is professional and academic-oriented, designed to cater to serious researchers. It includes a dense layout with many features that can appear cluttered to new users but provide extensive functionalities for experienced users. For example, the layout divided into “document” tab which enable users to search for documents based on the fields and title or cited references and “researchers” tab which enable users to search for specific researchers’ publications.

3.   Search Functionalities: WoS boasts powerful search capabilities, including advanced Boolean search options and the ability to explore citation networks. It offers comprehensive filters and sorting options to help users pinpoint relevant research. For example, the “add row” button enable additional searching criteria, “add date range” button enable both way of publication’s date filtering (manual input or click and select the option provided) and “advanced search” button enable query search.

#### 5.2.2 Weaknesses
The dense and feature-rich interface may be overwhelming for new users, requiring more time to learn and navigate effectively.

### 5.3	ScienceDirect
